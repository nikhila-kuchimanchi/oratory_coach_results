# Oratory Coach Results

This project is a simple web-based feedback system for an oratory coach application. It provides individual feedback on various aspects of a speech, including facial gestures, body gestures, posture, sentiment and tone analysis, grammar evaluation, and disfluencies detection. Each section of feedback is displayed on separate pages, and a central results overview page provides navigation links to these individual reports.
